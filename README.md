The goal of this repository is to implement and compare two paradigms for the automatic segmentation of brain gliomas on MRI scans (BraTS/Decathlon dataset): 
1. **Seeded Region Growing** (similarity-based approach).
2. **Marker-Controlled Watershed** (topographic approach).

The entire pipeline is developed in **MATLAB** (2025b version) without the use of neural networks (Deep Learning) or machine learning, to demonstrate the robustness of classic processing algorithms.

## Dataset Download
The original MRI data (in NIfTI `.nii.gz` format) is required to run the code. Due to file size constraints, they are not included directly in this repository.

**Import Instructions:**
1. To download the dataset, visit the following shared OneDrive folder: **[Download Dataset](https://shorturl.at/3DwTw)**
2. Download the required files.
3. Move the downloaded content into the `dataset/` folder located in the main directory of this repository.
