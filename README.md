## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement, evaluate and compare a segmentation pipeline for brain tumors using MRI scans from the BraTS (Medical Segmentation Decathlon) dataset. 

The analysis compares 5 distinct experimental configurations:
1. **Single FLAIR**
2. **Single T1c**
3. **Single T2**
4. **Bimodal Fusion (FLAIR + T1c)**
5. **Multimodal Fusion (FLAIR + T1c + T2)**

The segmentation is achieved through a cascaded pipeline: **Multi-level Otsu Thresholding -> Region Growing -> Marker-Controlled Watershed**, which prevents over-segmentation while maintaining high precision.

## Running Instructions

**Step 1: Download Dataset**

The original MRI data (in NIfTI `.nii.gz` format) is required to run the code. Due to file size constraints, they are not included directly in this repository.
1. To download the dataset, visit the following shared OneDrive folder: **[Download Dataset](https://shorturl.at/3DwTw)**
2. Download the required files.
3. Move the downloaded content into the `dataset/` folder located in the main directory of this repository.

**Step 2: Environment Setup**
1. Open **MATLAB**.
2. Set the `brain-tumor-segmentation-matlab` folder as your **Current Folder** in MATLAB (or open the associated .prj file directly).
   
**Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1. Open and run the `data_exploration.m` script.
2. **What to expect:** This script isolates a single patient and generates plots of the 4 MRI sequences, their respective intensity histograms and a 3D rendering (`volshow`) of the volume.

**Step 4: Pipeline Execution**
1. Open and run the `main.m` script.
2. **What to expect:** The script will automatically loop through the dataset. You will see real-time updates in the MATLAB **Command Window** showing the Dice Score for each of the 5 configurations per patient.
3. **Outputs:** The pipeline exports results in the `results/` folder, organized as follows:
   - `metrics/`: Contains `detailed.csv` (per-patient metrics) and `global.csv` (aggregated Dice, Sensitivity, Precision).
   - `plots/<patient_name>/`: A dedicated folder for each patient, further divided into:
     - `pre_processing/`: Breakdown of raw data, Z-Score normalization, median filter for denoising and fusion steps.
     - `segmentation/`: Step-by-step evolution (Otsu -> Region Growing -> Watershed) and the final comparison.
     - `post_processing/`: Before/After morphological refinement comparisons.
